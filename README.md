# ResoPhys
Official implementation of ResoPhys (IEEE JBHI). A novel unsupervised and plug-and-play framework for remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) measurement from facial videos of arbitrary resolution.

ResoPhys is a novel framework for remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) that robustly handles facial videos of any resolution. This addresses a key challenge in real-world scenarios where camera-to-subject distances fluctuate. Our approach is fully unsupervised and designed as a plug-and-play module to enhance existing rPPG models.
